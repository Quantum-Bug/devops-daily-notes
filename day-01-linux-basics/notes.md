# Linux Notes – Day 01

Linux is a multi-user, multitasking operating system.

### Important Directories
| Directory | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| / | Root directory |
| /home | User home folders |
| /etc | Config files |
| /var | Logs |

| /usr | User binaries |

Everything in Linux is treated as a file.
